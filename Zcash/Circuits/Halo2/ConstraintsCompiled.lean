Compiled gate vanishing, copy equality, and lookup membership establish the source
constraints and hence the specification for the extracted witness.

/-! ## Compiled constraints

The public boundary consists of compiled gate evaluations, resolved copy equality,
and tuple membership at compiled lookup activations. Selector compression, query
indexing, placement, and constant allocation are discharged internally. Fixed
assignments are already true in the circuit-owned environment.
