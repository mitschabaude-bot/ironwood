# VK-match test: the full Orchard Action circuit `configure`

Projects the `ConstraintSystem` produced by the ported `Action.Circuit.configure` to the
ironwood `CsFixture` shape and checks it EQUAL to the fixtures dumped from the actual
Rust circuit — both pre-compression (`actionPre.json`) and, via the Rust-dumped selector
map applied mechanically, post-`compress_selectors` (`actionPost.json`). `configure` is
version-independent (post-NU 6.2 and 6.3 share the CS), so this single test covers both
top-level circuits.

The fixtures are JSON data files loaded at `#eval` time (see `Fixtures/Json.lean` for
the codec, the pinned-content-hash scheme, and why the data is not a Lean term); a
mismatch or failed load is a build failure, exactly like the former `#guard`s.
