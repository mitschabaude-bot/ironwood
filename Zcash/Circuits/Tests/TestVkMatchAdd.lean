# VK-match test: the complete-addition (`add::Config`) gadget

The first end-to-end VK match for Halo2-Clean. Runs the ported `Add.add.configure` on the same
columns the Rust harness used (`advices[0..8]` in the roles
`x_p, y_p, x_qr, y_qr, lambda, alpha, beta, gamma, delta`), projects the resulting
`ConstraintSystem` to the ironwood `CsFixture` shape, and checks it **equal** to the fixture
dumped from the actual Rust circuit (`AddPre.lean` / `AddPost.lean`).

* `addPre`  — pre-selector-compression (gates still carry `.selector 0`).
* `addPost` — post-`compress_selectors` (the single `q_add` selector packed into one new
  fixed column; every `.selector 0` replaced by `.fixed 0`).

The comparison is `#guard` on `DecidableEq CsFixture`, so CI fails on any drift between the
Lean Add port and the Rust constraint system.

This file is part of the small, readable **documentation** suite of the VK-matching
approach — two leaf gadgets, each with both sides: Add (this file + `TestVkLayoutAdd`;
the minimal example) and Mul (`TestVkMatchMul` + `TestVkLayoutMul`; the LOOKUP and
selector-compression example). The check that the real circuit is correct is the
top-level suite: `TestVkMatchAction` (configure, both versions) + `TestVkLayoutAction`
(ironwood synthesize) + `TestVkLayoutActionBase` (pre-ironwood synthesize) — the other
per-gadget tests were subsumed by those and retired (see git history).
