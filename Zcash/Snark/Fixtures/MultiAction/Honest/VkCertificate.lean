# The multi-action verifying key, certified derived

The captured multi-action verifying key equals the key derived end-to-end from the ported
`configure`/keygen at the captured URS — transported from the single-action certificate
(`Keygen/Certificate.lean`), never re-evaluating keygen. Two facts make the transport
definitional: the two dumps carry one and the same URS and verifying-key commitment points
(`Fixtures/PostNu63.lean`). Verifying keys are indexed only by the circuit-owned shape, so the
proof count does not enter this transport.
