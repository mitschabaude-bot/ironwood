# Captured-data straight-line interface test, with eleven live IPA rounds

This interface fixture runs the zero prover against captured scalar/layout data at `k = 11`.
Commitments remain zero because sampled AGM bases need not represent captured points.

This remains a fixture-local interface test, pinned by the fixture census.
