# The Action circuit's knowledge-soundness contract

The first instance of `KnowledgeContract`, gathering what
`orchard_action_adaptiveStatement_knowledge_error_bound` promises about the deployed Orchard Action
circuit.

Reading it answers the questions the endpoint's own statement answers only by traversing the layers
underneath it:

* **Runs.** A generator random-oracle table together with one Fiat–Shamir transcript, drawn
  independently. The basis is read from the table by `orchardGeneratorROBasis`.
* **Acceptance.** `ComputedAdaptiveActionStatementFSFamily.accepts`, which is halo2's checked
  acceptance at the adversary's own selected public inputs and proof.
* **Witness.** `ActionTerminal.ActionBundleWitness`, the private witnesses of every Action in the
  bundle carrying their `ActionSpec` satisfaction proofs.
* **Statement.** `BundleStatement`, the semantic conclusion for every Action in the bundle.
* **Failure.** Accepted, yet the executable extractor returned nothing.
* **Error.** The compositional formula the endpoint proves, in the adversary's DL advantage and the
  per-surface Schwartz–Zippel budgets.

Assumptions stay in the signature below rather than in the record: the nonzero generator, the
injective oracle-parameter query, the family construction, and the generic DL advantage profile.
That profile carries caller-supplied prover and reduction work labels; operational accounting is
the separate `AdaptiveStatementAdversaryCostCertificate` and
`CertifiedAdaptiveStatementDlogProfile` route consumed by
`orchard_action_adaptiveStatement_certified_knowledge_error_bound`. The ledger continuation begins
per Action at `Zcash.Security.Ledger.Bridge.actionSpecToLedgerData`; it is not part of this
contract.
