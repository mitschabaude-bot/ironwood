# General theory for the computable polynomial representation

`CompPoly.CPolynomial R` is `{ p : Array R // no trailing zeros }`: a canonical representation, so
`DecidableEq` is available and every ring operation is executable.  `CPolynomial.toPoly` is one
half of a proven ring isomorphism onto Mathlib's `Polynomial R`, which is what lets the two views
be identified freely.

This file collects the theory the Zcash development needs on top of what CompPoly already proves.
Everything in the `CompPoly.CPolynomial` namespace below is stated generically and is intended to
be upstreamed; it is kept here only so the migration does not block on an external repository.
The Zcash-specific part is the `Fp` instantiation at the end.

## Why this exists at all

Mathlib's `Polynomial` instances live in a `noncomputable section`.  A definition that touches
one becomes `noncomputable`, and that marker propagates through every downstream definition
without being visible at any of their definition sites.  Nothing here is `noncomputable`.

/-! ## Evaluation algebra

CompPoly proves `eval_C`, `eval_mul`, `eval_one` and `eval_sub`; the additive and `X`/`pow` cases
are proved here.  Together they form a simp set that discharges the evaluation inductions in the
verifier layer without any manual transport to the Mathlib image. -/

CompPoly has no `map`: nothing pushes a ring hom through the coefficients, which is why every
change of coefficient ring so far had to detour through `Polynomial.map`.  `map` below is that
operation, computable — apply `f` entrywise and re-canonicalise, since a non-injective `f` can
create trailing zeros. -/

`toPoly` is a ring isomorphism, so divisibility transports.  `modByMonic` is CompPoly's own
executable remainder; the algebra it satisfies is Mathlib's, read across the isomorphism. -/

Mathlib's `Polynomial.roots` — the multiset of roots counted with multiplicity, obtained by
repeated factorisation over a domain.  It is `noncomputable` there and stays so here; multiplicity
over an abstract domain is not something one runs.  These are thin wrappers, so the factorisation
theory applies to the computable representation without a detour through `toPoly` at every use. -/

/-! ## Distinct roots over an enumerated field

`Polynomial.roots` is a `Multiset` obtained by repeated factorisation and is `noncomputable`.  Over
an enumerable field the set of *distinct* roots is a filter over the enumeration, so it can be a
plain `def`.  Keeping it computable costs nothing and means it can never poison a downstream
definition — the failure mode that motivated this migration.

To be clear about what "computable" buys: nobody *runs* this.  The enumeration has
`scalarFieldOrder` elements, so evaluating it would exhaust memory.  It only ever appears inside
`Prop`s, where the bad-set predicate is decided by a single evaluation instead
(`Zcash.Snark.decidableMemSzBadSet`).  The point is that a `def` mentioning it stays a `def`.

The guard at zero preserves Mathlib's convention that the zero polynomial has no roots, which is
what makes `roots_eq_toFinset` an unconditional equality. -/
